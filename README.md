# sieve-of-eratosthenes
The same [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) in various languages.

Currently implemented in:
* C
* Rust
* Java
* Python
* Ruby

## Note
This is a collab mainly bewteen [@thisryan](https://github.com/thisryan) and I.  
It's by design that we didn't use any language specifc features, we just did the same plain loops to do some basic runtime comparisons between different languages.  
Also we used this project to try to some new languages didn't know yet.  
Please don't use our implementations if you need a quick and reliabale one for production :)
